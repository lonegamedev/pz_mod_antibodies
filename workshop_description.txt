The Antibodies mod enhances the vanilla zombification mechanic by introducing an antibodies curve inspired by real-life immune system responses. If the antibodies successfully counteract the infection, the character will experience a gradual recovery over time.

[h2]How it Works[/h2]

As you get infected, the Knox Virus in your body spreads. Alongside, your body slowly mounts an immunological response.

The antibodies output rate is tied to infection progression (peaks at 50% infection), your condition, wounds, infections and hygiene.

Your job is to sustain all positive effects, and reduce all negative effects (see diagnose panel) - so that antibodies can overtake the infection and eradicate the virus.

Playing as character with medical background actually makes sense now, since it allows you to diagnose yourself and others, and also provide significant bonuses while treating wounds.

By default, sandbox settings are rather forgiving. The easiest way to tweak that is by changing "Base Antibodies Growth" property in General section.

[h1]FAQ:[/h1]

[b]Will this mod work if I install it after my character got infected?[/b]
Yes, unless you are past certain point. Infection length is randomized, but it takes between 2-3 days to resolve (either way).

[b]I've been nursing my character back to health for several days now, and he hasn't died, but it still says he's bitten. Should it be taking this long?[/b]

Most likely you are confusing a wound and the infection. Wound will stay with you for a while, even if you survive the virus - but it will eventually heal.

[b]Does this mod work in multiplayer mode?[/b]
Yes, including local co-op.

[b]Susceptible Mod compatibility?[/b]
Yes. Investigated by @The Animeville Horror. Thanks again.

[b]Does antibiotics pill found in the game help at all?[/b]
In real life antibiotics don't do anything against viruses. It will help by healing bacterial infections, however it won't do anything against Knox Virus.

[b]How can I make sure this mod works?[/b]
Create a character with medical background (with +2 First Aid) - this will add diagnose button in your health panel.
This is also the best way to tailor sandbox settings to your needs.

[h1]Update Schedule:[/h1]

I have constrained myself to update only Tue-Thu. All potential problems with the update should be resolved in this time window.

I do however reserve a right to fix critical issues ASAP (for example when game update breaks the mod).
