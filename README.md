# Antibodies (Project Zomboid Mod)

The Antibodies mod enhances the vanilla zombification mechanic by introducing an antibodies curve inspired by real-life immune system responses. If the antibodies successfully counteract the infection, the character will experience a gradual recovery over time.

## Build script

To streamline the update process and minimize errors, a Python build script is used to convert the source code into a mod and a workshop package.

To build the project, you can run build.sh or build_dev.sh, which serve as wrappers for the Python build script build.py.

Alternatively, if you're using Windows or prefer direct execution, you can run the Python build script (build.py) directly.

## Translations

- **Build 42** expects translations in UTF-8 encoding.
- **Build 41** has varying encoding requirements depending on the language.

***To streamline this, the Python build script automatically converts UTF-8 encoded translations from Build 42 into the appropriate encoding for Build 41.*** 

**How to:**

1. Place your **UTF-8** translation files in the `source/common/media/shared/Translate/[LANG_CODE]` directory (refer to existing translations as examples).
2. Run the Python build script (among other steps it will automatically convert the translations for Build 41).

In case something is converted incorrectly check `build_41_encoding_map` in `build.py`, they are based on https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Translations

**If youâ€™re working on a translation and prefer not to use the Python script:**
1. Download the latest release,
2. Follow `Manual installation` instructions (below).
2. Place the new translation files under `common/media/shared/Translate/[LANG_CODE]` for **Build 42 only**. 

This should be sufficient for development purposes.

## Manual Installation

To manually install the mod, place the directory generated by the Python builder in the appropriate location:

- On **Linux**: `~/Zomboid/mods/`
- On **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\Zomboid\mods\`

Make sure to unsubscribe from Steam Workshop version (to ensure local version will be used).
